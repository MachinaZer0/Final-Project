# MY FANTASY 
<link https://github.com/MachinaZer0/Final-Project.git>

## Description
    I want to recreate a simplified battle system represented in the recently shut down game, Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.

## Features
    Party - a group of 5 characters that act as your team
    Enemies - enemy opponents that the party needs to kill
    Skill list - a list of abilities that both the party and enemies could use
    Win/lose condition - win when all enemies are killed, lose when whole party is killed

## Challenges
    Keyboard/Mouse input implementation.
    I will need to learn how to keep strong organization of code while having lots of screen changing based on player input.
    Music implementation.

## Ideal Outcome
    Full working display, showing both party and enemy layout on top of screen, and party stats/abilities on bottom half of screen.
    Complete (albeit mediocre) set of animations for different actions that the party/enemies use.

## Minimal Outcome
    Mostly functional display, displaying enemies on top of screen, and the party stats on the bottom of the screen.
    Only functioning actions being attacking and blocking, while only having one enemy to avoid a targeting system.

## Milestones
    # Week 1
        - Get basic variables and stats set up. 
        - Have basic visual aspect with simple squares sitting on top of eachother.
        - Only 1 unit in party/enemy field. 
        - Create keyboard inputs. 
        - Create attack option to check if damage can be dealt to enemies.

    # Week 2
        - Develop ability list for 1 party unit, and 1 enemy unit. 
        - Create turn based system.
        - Develop simple rules for the enemy to follow for when to use certain abilites.

    # Week 3
        - Add more party members and enemies. 
        - Create targeting system for both party, and enemies.

    # Week 4
        - Add music. 
        - Add win/lose screen. 
        - Switch from keyboard controls, to mouse controls.

    # Week 5 (couple of days before due date)
        - Final touches for optimization
